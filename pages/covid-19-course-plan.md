title: "COVID-19 course plan"

In preparation for the event that classes at CSB/SJU are moved online, the
following plan is articulated:

## Asynchronous content delivery
1. Each week, several short videos will be assigned to complement the assigned
   readings from the book.
1. Each week, three problem-sets will be posted, similar in spirit to the daily
   assignments we have now, which will be submitted electronically and due the
   following Sunday [*AOE*][aoe].

## Synchronous digital office hours
1. I will be available for digital office hours, conducted using whichever mode
   of communication that you prefer / is appropriate for the purpose of the
   meeting.
   1. To schedule digital office hours, please schedule a meeting with me
      (preferably using Outlook), and indicate the purpose of the meeting and
      which technology would like to use / which you think would be best given
      the nature of the meeting.
