  \begin{frame}{a good question}
    \begin{block}{\color{OliveGreen}why bother?}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item better debugger
        \item better programmer
        \item better problem-solver
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \note{
      most of you will neither write nor maintain compilers nor will you program
      in assembly on a regular basis, so then why bother\dots

      \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{10pt}
        \item better debugger --- improve tracing skill and have a better idea
          of how things you write are understood by the machine
        \item better programmer --- debugging is a skill that many
          ``programmers'' lack, but you will have improved this skill therefore,
          you will be a better programmer
        \item better problem-solver --- because of your new understanding of the
          orgranization of a computer system you will better understand its
          capabilities and limitations --- you will also gain experience moving
          between levels of abstraction, thus improving your abstract thinking

  \begin{frame}{a look ahead}
    \begin{itemize}

        techniques}

    \end{itemize}

    \only<2>{\note{we need to be able to reason about the algorithms that we
      design. we need some way to compare different algorithms that solve the
      same problem to understand which is better and when\dots bubble sort is
      easy to understand and implement, however, it is only the right best
      sorting algorithm under very specific circumstances.}}
    \only<3>{\note{algorithm design is not a process that starts from a blank
      slate every time --- complex problem-solving often relies on building
      blocks or reformulating one problem as another --- we will be learning

  \begin{frame}{teaching philosophy}
    Your job is to empower those you teach; when you do for them what they
    should be doing for themselves, you create dependency rather than
    empowerment.

    It is easy to give in to the frustration that results from seeing amazing
    possibilities for the people you are teaching, and you want it more for them
    than they want it for themselves. 

    Don‚Äôt give in to that frustration! \\

      Matthew Kelly}

    \note{I sincerely believe that all of you can master this material and I
      want more than anything else this semester, to help you do that!}
    \note{However, don't expect me to give you answers. And do get frusterated
      with me when I challenge you to discover the answers for yourself.}
