## Preface
The CSCI 338 Syllabus serves to set forth what is expected during the semester
from the instructor and the students and to guide the behaviors of both parties.
More specifically, this syllabus delineates the responsibilities of students and
of the instructor for various tasks, including attendance, assignments,
examinations, and other requirements. It also describes appropriate procedures
and course policies so that both students and the instructor know ahead of time
how certain potential occurrences---such as missing an exam or submitting a late
assignment---will be handled.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]

## Introduction
### Purpose
Computers are only as good as the programs they run, and programs are only as
good as the algorithms that underlie them. There are many good methods for
developing an algorithm to solve a given problem, and there are many techniques
for determining whether an algorithm will perform well. For some problems,
however, it is difficult, if not impossible to find useful algorithms.

CSCI 338 will focus on techniques for developing algorithmic solutions to
problems and the means of evaluating those algorithms. Students who successfully
complete this course will be able:

* to use different abstract methodologies to construct algorithms that solve
  given problems
* to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms and compare the
  complexity of different algorithms
* to describe the complexity classes ùí´ and ùí©ùí´ and explain why they are important
  in understanding computational tractability
* to write a good description and analysis of an algorithm

### Requirements
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

Students are REQUIRED to have access to the textbook, *Introduction to the
Design and Analysis of Algorithms* by Anany Levitin. This course is based on the
third edition of the book, thus, it is RECOMMENDED that students acquire this
edition.

### Terminology
class meeting
: A meeting scheduled during the time slot assigned to the course and during the
  university approved academic calendar for the relevant semester. Such meetings
  will normally take place in the assigned classroom, however, they MAY occur
  elsewhere.

excused absence
: An absence from a scheduled class meeting with prior permission from the
  instructor. In the event that prior permission cannot be obtained, the student
  MUST notify the instructor of the reason for the absence as soon as reasonably
  possible. Reasons for missing a class meeting that qualify as excused include,
  but are not limited to, documented illness, death in your family, varsity
  athletic events (MUST NOT be practices), or other performances.

unexcused absence
: An absence that is not excused.

original work
: An original work is one not received from others nor one copied from or based
  upon the work of others.

closed book
: The book and any accompanying materials MUST NOT be used.

open note
: A single 8.5" x 11" piece of paper, front and back with nothing attached MAY
  be used.

## Course policies
### Attendance
Attendance is REQUIRED at all class meetings. Each unexcused absence MAY result
in a 1% reduction in the final grade for the course. Students who have more than
three unexcused absences MAY receive a failing grade for the course. Habitual
lateness in attending class meetings MAY be treated as unexcused absence.

### Assignments
There will be several assignments during the semester including: readings,
in-class exercises, and take-home exercises. All of these assignments are
intended to be collaborative in nature and you are encouraged to work together
to understand the material and come up with solutions. However, all work
submitted for a grade MUST be your own original work. Late assignment
submissions MAY NOT be accepted.

### Examinations
There will be four take-home exams. All exams are open book/open note. The due
dates for all exams are documented on the [Canvas calendar] for this course; you
are responsible for keeping those times clear in your schedule. Students MAY be
allowed to make up missed exams in the case of an excused absence and at the
discretion of the instructor.

### Emails / Outlook meeting invitations
I welcome emails and Outlook meeting invitations from students. However, you
SHOULD use the following guidelines when sending either to me:
* start the subject line with CS338, CS 338, CSCI338, or CSCI 338
* provide a concise description in subject line
* use a salutation like, "Good afternoon Prof. Iverson" or just "Prof. Iverson"
* conclude your message with a signature like, "Sincerely, Jeremy" or even as
  simple as just "Jeremy", to indicate who the message is from
* use standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and grammar

If you fail to incorporate any of the above suggestions when corresponding with
me via email or meeting invitations, then I MAY NOT respond in a timely manner,
or for grievous infractions, at all.

### Evaluation
The final grade for the course will be based on the percentages shown below.

| Written assignments     | 24% |
| Programming assignments | 12% |
| Take-home exams         | 64% |

Grading is mainly based on the performance of each student compared to the class
as a whole. In general, the following guidelines are followed except in certain
situations where the instructor sees a need for adjustments. A grade of F MAY be
given in situations of frequent unexcused absences, unsuccessful completion of
required work in a timely manner, or evident lack of understanding of core
material as illustrated by exam scores (e.g., failing all exams MAY result in an
F grade regardless of your total final score).

| A  | &ge;94% |
| AB | &ge;87% |
| B  | &ge;84% |
| BC | &ge;77% |
| C  | &ge;74% |
| CD | &ge;67% |
| D  | &ge;64% |
| F  | &lt;64% |

## Inclusivity
Students in this class are encouraged to speak up and participate in-class and
online. Each of us must show respect for each other because our class represents
a diversity of beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. It is this breadth of
perspectives that will enrich all of our experiences together. Our individual
differences will deepen our understanding of one another and the world around
us, rather than divide us. In this class, people of all ethnicities, genders and
gender identities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities,
socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities are strongly encouraged to
share their rich array of perspectives and experiences. If you feel your
differences may in some way isolate you from our classroom community or if you
have a specific need, please speak with me early in the semester so that we can
work together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class and
community. *(Adapted from [Humbolt State University][Humbolt] and [Winona State
University][Winona])*

## Basic needs security
Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food
to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes
this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of
Students for support. Furthermore, please notify the instructor if you are
comfortable doing so. This will enable them to provide any resources that they
may have. *(From [Sara Goldrick-Rab][Medium])*

## Special accommodations
Students needing special accommodations or who have special needs are invited to
share this information with the instructor as early as possible.

## Scholastic conduct
Work must be completed in a manner consistent with the College of Saint
Benedict's & Saint John's University's codes for academic honesty. All outside
work and/or ideas used in any part of this course must be properly attributed;
all forms of plagiarism including ‚Äî but not limited to ‚Äî copying the ideas and
the written and/or spoken words of others and copying or annexing computer files
from other people are strictly prohibited. All acts of plagiarism, cheating, or
other academic misconduct are considered forms of academic dishonesty and are
strictly prohibited. Such instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to
the appropriate personnel and officials. Please refer to the most recent version
of the College of Saint Benedict & Saint John's University's Academic Catalog
for further relevant information and guidelines on this matter.

## Extra Help
This is a challenging course and exposes students to several new algorithmic
concepts and programming environments in a relatively short amount of time.
Students are strongly encouraged to seek help from the instructor on course
material when needed. Please contact me during office hours or by appointment to
discuss a homework problem or any aspect of the course.
